1. The purpose of this app is to allow users to store personal recipes and get ideas from featured recipes from other users.
2. User Roles: Explanation of each role and what they can do
    Users: My project is a recipe site that allows users to document their own recipes and submit them to be reviewed so that they might appear on the 'Featured Recipes' page. Users will be able to create a copy of any featured recipe to their own collection and edit it how they like. Users can edit and delete their recipes in their personal collection. If a user gets one of their recipes on the featured page, they can delete it if wanted, but cannot edit it.

    Contributors: Has the authorizations as users plus Contributors can see the submissions list and either accept or reject a given submitted recipe including recipes they made themselves. If the recipe is rejected, the owner of the recipe is notified and the recipe is removed from the submissions list. If a recipe is accepted, the owner is notified, it is removed from the submissions list, and moved to the 'Featured Recipe' page. Contributors will allowed to delete any recipe on the 'Featured Recipe' and moderate as needed.

    Admin: Has all the authorizations as users and contributors, as well as has a secret admin page that contains information on each user, namely their 'user_id', 'email', 'role', and 'created_at'. There will be a search bar on this page to look up specific emails. The admin can change the role of any user to be either, admin, contributor, or user. 
3. Test Account Credentials: Username or email for one account of each role type.
